Q:  Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)

Q:  What is the output?
    The output depends on that fact that the RISC-V is little-endian. 
    If the RISC-V were instead big-endian what would you set i to in order to yield the same output? 
    Would you need to change 57616 to a different value?
A:  HE110 World; 0x00726c64; NO.

Q:  In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
